# Creating new animations

**HELP**: If you get stuck on any part of this guide, or have any questions about the systems available, I can normally be contacted on Discord under the @epicguru handle or by opening an issue on this page.

Inside the `Source/Animations` folder is a Unity project that is used to create the animations for this mod.  
The [Unity Animation Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/animeditor-UsingAnimationEditor.html) is used to create animations using keyframes - if you have used Blender, Spine or other keyframe animation software, you will find it quite easy to use.  
A full Unity and Unity animation tutorial is outside the scope of this guide, so please take some time to understand the editor if you are not already familiar with it.

 - Install Unity Editor version 6 (6000.0) or above.
 - Add the Animation project, in the `Source/Animations`, to Hub to allow you to open it:  ![Intro Screen](OpenProject.png "The first screen")
 - Open the Animation project. You may see a warning about changing the unity editor version, this is fine.
